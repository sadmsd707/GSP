// Here's the complete list of question numbers you need to create:
// Questions 71-80, 81-90, 91-100, 101-110, 111-120, 121-130, 131-140, 141-150, 151-166

// For the remaining questions, follow the same pattern. Since I can't see the exact content
// of all questions in the PDF, you'll need to extract them and format them similarly.

// Example for question 71:
// {
//   number: "Question 71",
//   text: "90 J of work is done to move an electric charge of magnitude 3 C from a place A, where potential is -10 V to another place B, where potential is 'V1' volt. The value of V1 is",
//   options: ["10 V", "20 V", "30 V", "40 V"],
//   correct: "B" // Example answer
// },

// Continue this for all 166 questions

    // Note: I've provided 100 questions here as examples. The PDF contains many questions with options like "A", "B", "C", "D" 
    // but without the actual option texts in the PDF content. For a complete implementation of all 373 questions,
    // you would need to extract all the questions and their options from the PDF.

    // The structure above shows how to format each question. You would continue adding questions up to 373.
